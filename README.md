# Cyclistic-capstone

This project is a part of the Google Data Analytics Capstone project course. This is Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study!


The goal is to analyze how do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently.
1. Casual riders: Riders who do not have any membership
2. Member riders: Riders who have membership**
